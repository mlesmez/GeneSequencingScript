# GeneSequencingScript
Labs can determine the location of base pairs (ACTG) in a gene, up to a certain probability. A Fastq file shows the base pairs in order and gives each one a ASCII character below them that shows the certainty that the basepair above is what is shown. I wrote my script for a biology professor to sort through a Fastq file of fly genes and sent each line into a low, medium, or high confidence file meaning how sure we are the base pairs in the line are what they say they are.
