# GeneSequencingScript
Labs can determine the location of base pairs (ACTG) in a gene, up to a certain probability. A Fastq file shows the base pairs in order and gives each one a ASCII character below them that shows the certainty that the basepair above is what is shown. I wrote my script for a biology professor to sort through a Fastq file of fly genes and sent each line into a low, medium, or high confidence file meaning how sure we are the base pairs in the line are what they say they are. 

If you would like to run the code you must run it on a IDE that supports python and download the fly genes spreadsheat to the same folder in your files heiarchy.
